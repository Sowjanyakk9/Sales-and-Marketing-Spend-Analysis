Sales and Marketing Spend Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between Marketing Spend and Sales Revenue using a dataset. By exploring the data and visualizing trends, the goal is to understand how marketing, pricing, product ratings, and seasonality affect sales performance. Key insights will help businesses optimize their strategies.

Key Steps
Data Cleaning:

Check for missing values and remove unnecessary columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand data patterns.
Investigate correlations between marketing spend and sales.
Visualizations:

Scatter plot: Marketing spend vs sales.
Bar plot: Average sales by category.
Heatmap: Correlation between variables.
Key Metrics:

Total Sales: The sum of sales revenue.
Total Marketing Spend: The sum of marketing spend.
ROI: Ratio of sales to marketing spend.
Dashboard:

An interactive dashboard built with Dash and Plotly to display KPIs and dynamic graphs.
Users can filter the data by category and see updates on sales, marketing spend, and ROI.
Insights
Marketing Spend: Increasing marketing spend may not always directly increase sales.
Price and Discount: Price and discount strategies are key to boosting sales.
Seasonality: Sales can vary based on seasonal trends.
Category Impact: Some product categories show higher sales.
How to Run the Project
Install dependencies: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, dash, plotly.
Run the Notebook:

Open the Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
Run the notebook cells sequentially.

Start the Dashboard:

The Dash app will run directly within the Jupyter Notebook.
Once you run the relevant cell, it will automatically launch the app at a specific port (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8051/).
Access the Dashboard:
You will see the interactive dashboard embedded in the notebook or accessed via a URL in your browser.
